As u cannot create readthedocs for private repos, here are the steps to view the docs after merging the pull request
cd <clonedir>
git clone git@github.com:arita37/da.git
cd da
virtualenv -p python3 daenv
daenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd docs/
make html
open file in the browser as file:///<clonedir>/da/docs/build/html/index.html



This is for your question about the branch.
https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/versions.html

Actually dev is the default branch for the repo, so it will build fro this, but as it is a private repo, so will not work.
